## How It Works

### Token Generation

The user can enter a desired token length and click the **Generate Token** button. A random alphanumeric token is generated and displayed. The token can then be copied to the clipboard.

### Theme Toggle (Dark Mode)

The application supports both light and dark modes. You can switch between them by clicking the **Theme Toggle** button located in the app header.

### Form Validation

The token length is validated using **Yup** to ensure that users input a valid number within the acceptable range. Invalid inputs are flagged with an error message.
